# Exploit Automated RCE Vulnerability Scanner for Web Applications

## Overview

The Exploit Automated RCE Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based web application designed to automate the detection of Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in web applications. It employs a variety of payloads targeting different injection techniques, including command injection, PHP code injection, Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), SQL injection, NoSQL injection, XPath injection, XML External Entity (XXE) injection, and Object Injection.

## Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Scan target URLs for RCE vulnerabilities using predefined payloads.
- **Payload Variety:** Includes a wide range of payloads for different injection techniques.
- **Web Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface for inputting URLs and viewing scan results.
- **Customizable and Extensible:** Easily customizable to add new payloads or modify existing ones.
- **Reports:** Generates simple reports in text or HTML format summarizing scan results.
