## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! Here, I showcase two projects developed during my internship at Albus Security. Each project addresses critical aspects of cybersecurity and vulnerability assessment.

### Client-Server Keylogger

The Client-Server Keylogger is designed to capture and log keystrokes from a client machine, transmitting them securely to a server for storage and analysis. It employs a client-server architecture and facilitates remote monitoring of keystrokes, ideal for security audits and monitoring.

### Exploit Automated RCE Vulnerability Scanner for Web Applications

The Exploit Automated RCE Vulnerability Scanner automates the detection of Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities in web applications. It uses various payloads to scan URLs for vulnerabilities like command injection, SQL injection, and more. This tool provides a comprehensive approach to identifying security weaknesses in web applications.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, cybersecurity principles, and software development for security applications. Each project includes detailed README files with setup instructions, usage guidelines, and project details. Explore each project's folder to delve into the code and discover more about their functionalities.
