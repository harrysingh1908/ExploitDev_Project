# Client-Server Keylogger

This project is developed as part of an internship project with Albus Security. The aim is to create a tool to capture and store keystrokes on a target system, storing the data locally in a file for analysis. The tool uses a client-server architecture where the client captures keystrokes and sends them to the server, which logs the keystrokes and stores them in a text file.

## Features

- Capture and log keystrokes from a client system.
- Send captured keystrokes to a server over HTTP.
- Log received keystrokes with timestamps on the server.
- Store keystrokes in a local text file on the server for analysis.

## Repository Contents

- `server.py`: Flask server to receive and log keystrokes.
- `keylogger.py`: Client-side script to capture keystrokes and send them to the server.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harrysingh1908/ExploitDev_Project.git
    cd ExploitDev_Project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    
## Usage

1. **Starting the Server**:

    Run the `server.py` script on the machine where you want to log the keystrokes:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. **Running the Keylogger on the Client**:

   Update the `SERVER_URL` in `keylogger.py` with the IP address of the machine running the Flask server. For example:
   
    Then run the keylogger script on the client machine:

    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```

3. **Logging and Viewing Keystrokes**:

    - The server will print received keystrokes with timestamps in the terminal.
    - Keystrokes will also be logged to `keystrokes.txt` on the server machine.
  
      
## Notes

- Ensure that both the client and server machines are on the same network or that the server IP is accessible to the client.
- Adjust firewall and security settings as necessary to allow communication between the client and server over the specified port.
